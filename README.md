Daily Reminder to do my physical therapy because I forget...

How to use:
gcc -o any_name.exe main.c -mwindows

run the executable and the first 5 minutes it will appear then after N hours have passed (my case is 4) it will alert again.

runs in the background at around 130ish KB for me.
Learned how background processes works in windows.
